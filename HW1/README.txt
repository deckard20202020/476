The file you will run is hw1.py, just as in the homework description instructions.
You can run it just as the homework assignment says.
For example:

python hw1.py hw1_grid.json --alg bfs --out hw1_bfs.json

should output hw1_bfs.json, which contains the output of running breadth-first search,
including "visited" and "path" for the problem described in hw1_grid.json

Your choices for algorithms are bfs, dfs, and astar

You can easily add additional grids to test as well, following a similar format at that found in hw1_grid.json,
hw1_noGoalGrid.json, etc.  You can also choose a json file to specify where your results are output, just as
the example above or as the homework description explains.
